## Implementation Notes

### Demo Structure Guidelines

Each demo should follow this structure:
```
#! <Title>  <Brief Controls Description>
# <Feature explanation comments>
# <Implementation notes>

#=T <custom timing if needed>
#=<sound/color definitions as needed>

^<initial symbols>

<rules demonstrating the feature>

<quit rule back to menu>
```

### Progressive Complexity

- **Phases 1-2**: Single feature focus, minimal complexity
- **Phase 3**: Feature combinations, moderate complexity  
- **Phase 4**: Practical applications, game-like demos
- **Phase 5**: Advanced integrations, showcase programs

### Implementation Priority

Recommended implementation order:
1. Complete Phase 1 (core mechanics foundation)
2. Implement Phase 2 selectively based on interest
3. Focus on specific Phase 3-5 demos for particular use cases
4. Create comprehensive examples for documentation
