# Unicode Support Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Unicode/UTF-8 character support has been successfully implemented in the Zahradnice game engine, enabling display of non-ASCII characters like Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, etc.

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED
**Date Completed:** August 9, 2025
**Status:** Full wide character support implemented and tested

## Previous State (Before Implementation)
- Engine used single-byte `char` throughout
- Used standard ncurses library (`-lncurses`) 
- Display via `mvaddch()` for single characters
- All data structures assumed ASCII/single-byte characters

## Implemented Solution: wchar_t Approach

### Phase 1: Build System & Headers ✅ COMPLETED
- **Makefile**: Changed `-lncurses` to `-lncursesw` in both speed and size targets
- **Headers**: Changed `#include <ncurses.h>` to `#include <ncursesw/ncurses.h>`
- **Locale**: Added `setlocale(LC_ALL, "")` in main() for UTF-8 support

### Phase 2: Core Data Structure Changes ✅ COMPLETED
Replaced `char` with `wchar_t` in key structures:

**grammar.h changes implemented:**
```cpp
struct Start {
    char ul, lr;     // positioning unchanged
    wchar_t s;       // symbol: char -> wchar_t ✅
};

struct Rule {
    wchar_t lhs;     // rule left-hand side ✅
    std::wstring rhs; // rule right-hand side ✅
    wchar_t key;     // trigger key ✅
    wchar_t ctx;     // context character ✅
    wchar_t rep;     // replacement character ✅
    wchar_t ctxrep;  // context replacement ✅
    // ... other fields unchanged
};

struct G {
    wchar_t c;       // character: char -> wchar_t ✅
    char fore, back, zord;  // colors unchanged
};

// Main character storage
std::unordered_map<std::pair<int, int>, wchar_t, hash_pair> x; ✅
std::unordered_set<wchar_t> V; // non-terminals ✅
std::unordered_map<wchar_t, Rules> R; // rules map ✅
```

### Phase 3: Display Functions ✅ COMPLETED
- Replaced `mvaddch(r, c, ch)` with `mvadd_wch(r, c, &cchar)` ✅
- Implemented `wchar_t` to `cchar_t` structure conversion for ncursesw ✅
- Properly handle color attributes in `cchar_t` structure ✅
- Added wide character context reading using `mvwin_wch()` and `getcchar()` ✅

### Phase 4: File Parsing & Conversion ✅ COMPLETED
Implemented UTF-8 to wchar_t conversion:
```cpp
// Helper function to convert UTF-8 string to wchar_t
wchar_t utf8_to_wchar(const std::string& utf8_char) {
    wchar_t wc;
    mbstate_t state = {};
    size_t len = mbrtowc(&wc, utf8_char.c_str(), utf8_char.length(), &state);
    return (len > 0) ? wc : L'?';
}

// Helper function to convert UTF-8 string to wstring  
std::wstring string_to_wstring(const std::string& str) {
    // Uses std::mbstowcs for proper UTF-8 conversion
}
```

Updated parsing in `loadFromFile()` and `addRule()`:
- Extract UTF-8 characters from config files ✅
- Convert strings to `wstring` and individual characters to `wchar_t` ✅
- Maintain full backward compatibility with ASCII ✅

### Phase 5: Rule Processing Updates ✅ COMPLETED
Updated character iteration in:
- `origin()` - pattern matching in RHS using `wstring` iteration ✅
- `dryapply()` - context checking with wide character comparison ✅ 
- `apply()` - rule application and display with proper wide character handling ✅

All functions now use proper wide character processing with `wstring::c_str()` iteration.

## Implementation Results ✅
- **Full wide character support**: Engine now handles Unicode/UTF-8 characters throughout
- **Minimal disruption**: wchar_t integration maintains same API patterns
- **Native ncursesw support**: Direct use of `mvadd_wch()`, `mvwin_wch()`, `getcchar()` 
- **Backward compatible**: All existing ASCII programs work unchanged
- **Standard approach**: Uses standard C/POSIX wide character functions (`mbstowcs`, `mbrtowc`)
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All data structures, rules, and display functions support wide chars

## Verified Working ✅
**Test Status:** `programs/nihao.cfg` confirmed working with Unicode characters

The implementation now supports programs like:
```
# Chinese Hello World (example)
^你5 5
^好5 7
^世5 9  
^界5 11

=0你 你@
=0好 好@
=0世 世@
=0界 界@
```

**Results:** Unicode characters display correctly: 你好世界

## Final Implementation Notes ✅
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing ASCII programs continue to work unchanged
- **Testing**: Verified with existing programs (nihao.cfg confirmed working)
- **UTF-8 Support**: Full UTF-8 input file support with proper encoding
- **Terminal Requirements**: Requires UTF-8 capable terminal (standard on modern systems)
- **Build**: Successfully compiles with ncursesw linkage

## Testing Results ✅
1. **✅ ASCII Compatibility**: All existing programs work unchanged
2. **✅ Unicode Support**: Wide characters display and process correctly
3. **✅ Mixed Content**: ASCII/UTF-8 mixed content works properly
4. **✅ Build System**: Clean compilation with no errors or warnings

## Additional Enhancements Completed ✅

### Wide Character Input Support
**Date:** August 9, 2025  
**Enhancement:** Added support for wide character triggers from user input

**Changes Made:**
- **Input System**: Replaced `getch()` with `wget_wch()` for proper UTF-8 input handling
- **Key Processing**: Updated `step()` function signature from `char` to `wchar_t`  
- **Display Functions**: Implemented proper ncursesw display using `mvaddwstr()` with `wcswidth()` for accurate text positioning
- **Complete Consistency**: All string processing now uses `wstring` throughout, with UTF-8 conversion only at file I/O boundaries

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Wide character triggers (e.g., `ť`) work correctly from user input
- ✅ Help lines with Unicode characters display properly  
- ✅ Right-aligned text positioning handles wide characters correctly
- ✅ All existing ASCII functionality preserved

### System-Wide Audit Results ✅
**Verification:** Complete codebase audit confirmed proper UTF-8/wstring separation:
- ✅ **File I/O Boundary**: All external UTF-8 strings converted to `wstring` immediately upon reading
- ✅ **Internal Processing**: All rule processing, dictionary operations, and character handling use `wstring`/`wchar_t`
- ✅ **Display Output**: Proper ncursesw functions used for wide character display
- ✅ **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing programs continue to work unchanged

## Final Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅
**Date:** August 9, 2025  
**Result:** Full Unicode/UTF-8 support successfully implemented in Zahradnice game engine
**Compatibility:** 100% backward compatible with existing programs  
**Testing:** Verified working with Unicode test programs including wide character triggers
**Architecture:** Clean UTF-8 ↔ wstring conversion at I/O boundaries with full wide character processing internally
