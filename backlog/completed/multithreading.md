## Original Design (IMPLEMENTED)

Zahradnice implements multithreaded rule derivation to speed up complex scenarios like Conway's Game of Life by parallelizing rule applications while maintaining correctness through area-based conflict detection.

## Current Working Implementation

### Architecture

**Core Approach**: Area-based conflict detection with fine-grained locking
- Rules are selected randomly with area overlap checking
- Non-conflicting rules execute in parallel
- Screen operations are protected by fine-grained locks

### Key Components

**Configuration** (`grammar.h:94`, `grammar.cpp:151-155`):
```cpp
int thread_count = 0;  // 0 = auto-detect cores, 1 = single-threaded, N = use N threads
```
- Default: Auto-detect all available CPU cores
- Configurable per program with `#threads N` directive
- Falls back to original single-threaded `step()` when `thread_count <= 1`

**Data Structures**:
```cpp
struct RuleApplication {
    std::pair<int, int> position;
    Grammar2D::Rule rule;
    size_t rule_index;
    int weight;
};

struct ScreenArea {
    int min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col;
    bool overlaps(const ScreenArea& other) const;
};
```

**Thread Safety**:
```cpp
static std::mutex screen_mutex;  // Protects ncurses calls and shared data
```

### Algorithm Flow

1. **Rule Gathering** (`gatherApplicableRules()`):
   - Sequential collection of all applicable rules for current key/trigger
   - Includes DryRun context checking (apply_impl<true>)

2. **Conflict-Free Selection** (`stepMultithreaded()`):
   - Randomly select up to `thread_count` rules
   - Calculate screen area for each rule using `calculateRuleArea()`
   - Reject rules that overlap with already selected areas
   - Continue until no more non-conflicting rules found

3. **Parallel Application**:
   - Each selected rule runs in separate `std::async` thread
   - Fine-grained locking around screen operations:
     - `mvadd_wch()` (ncurses not thread-safe)
     - `screen_chars[]` and `memory[]` array updates
     - `x` map modifications

### Key Functions

**`stepMultithreaded()` (grammar.cpp:780)**:
- Main multithreaded entry point
- Replaces `step()` when `thread_count > 1`
- Handles rule selection, conflict detection, and parallel execution

**`calculateRuleArea()` (grammar.cpp:699)**:
- Computes bounding box of all non-space characters in rule's RHS
- Used for overlap detection between rules
- Includes coordinate wrapping for toroidal screen

**`gatherApplicableRules()` (grammar.cpp:744)**:
- Finds all rules matching current trigger key
- Performs context checking (DryRun) for each candidate
- Returns list of applicable rules with weights

### Performance Characteristics

**Measured Results**:
- 97% parallel execution rate in Conway's Game of Life
- ~120% CPU usage (vs potential 400% on 4-core system)
- Noticeable "super-linear" speedup in complex scenarios
- Threading stats displayed in status line: `MT: X/Y (Z%)`

**Bottlenecks**:
- Fine-grained locking serializes screen updates
- Rule application is very fast, limiting parallel benefits
- Context checking (DryRun) remains sequential in `gatherApplicableRules()`

## Configuration Usage

**Per-program configuration** in `.cfg` files:
```
#threads 4     # Use exactly 4 threads
#threads 0     # Auto-detect (default)
#threads 1     # Single-threaded (original behavior)
```

**Default behavior** when no `#threads` directive:
- Auto-detects hardware thread count via `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`
- Provides maximum performance out of the box
- Can be overridden per program as needed

## Experimental Approaches Attempted

### 1. Parallel DryRun with Area Exclusion
**Goal**: Parallelize the expensive context checking phase

**Approach**:
- Track currently applying rule areas
- Exclude overlapping candidates from parallel DryRun
- Check non-conflicting rules in parallel

**Result**: **Failed**
- Complex coordination overhead
- Memory leaks from unlimited `std::async` calls (40GB virtual memory)
- Severe performance degradation
- Thread explosion in complex scenarios (hundreds of rules)

### 2. Full Parallel Checking + Single Atomic Application
**Goal**: Maximum parallelism for DryRun, single rule application

**Approach**:
- Check ALL potential rules in parallel (no application happening)
- Randomly select one rule from results
- Apply atomically with no locking needed

**Result**: **Failed**
- Thread creation overhead overwhelming benefits
- No observable speedup, appeared sequential
- Conway's Game of Life creates 500+ rule checks per step
- `std::async` overhead destroyed performance

## Lessons Learned

1. **Thread count must be limited**: Unlimited parallelism creates more overhead than benefit
2. **Simple approaches work better**: Complex coordination adds overhead that defeats parallelism
3. **Context checking is expensive**: This is where parallelism helps most
4. **Rule application is fast**: Screen updates are not the bottleneck
5. **Area-based conflict detection works**: Clean separation prevents race conditions

## Future Improvement Ideas

### Thread Pool Implementation
Replace `std::async` with fixed thread pool to avoid thread creation overhead:
- Pre-allocate worker threads at startup
- Queue rule checks/applications to workers
- Reuse threads across steps

### Batch Processing
Process rules in controlled batches:
- Limit parallel DryRun to `thread_count * 2` rules maximum
- Process remaining rules sequentially
- Balance parallelism with overhead

### Lock-Free Data Structures
Investigate lock-free alternatives for shared data:
- Lock-free screen character array
- Atomic operations for memory updates
- Reduced lock contention

### SIMD Optimization
Vectorize context checking operations:
- Parallel character comparisons
- Batch coordinate calculations
- Platform-specific optimizations

## Current Status: Working Solution

The current implementation provides:
- ✅ **Reliable performance improvement** in complex scenarios
- ✅ **Thread-safe correctness** with area-based conflict detection
- ✅ **Configurable threading** per program
- ✅ **Graceful fallback** to single-threaded mode
- ✅ **Clean integration** with existing codebase

**Recommendation**: Keep current implementation as production solution. Future optimizations should build incrementally on this solid foundation.
